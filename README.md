### 🎮 Games

I like to build playable web games to explore logic and state management. You can play them directly in your browser!

**1. [Sudoku Logic Engine](https://kryoton98.github.io/Games/Sudoku%20Solver/)**
A visualizer comparing human heuristics (Constraint Propagation) against recursive backtracking. Features strict board validation and includes legendary NP-complete test cases like *AI Escargot*.
